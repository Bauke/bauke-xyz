# This `submodules` directory exists to hold external projects, but without using
# Git's submodule functionality (because they're kind of a pain in the ass to use).

# To initialize the submodules needed to build the website, run the following
# commands in this directory.

git clone git@git.holllo.cc/Bauke/userstyles.git
cd userstyles
yarn --silent

# Then, if they ever need to be updated, just pull the changes and run Yarn
# again, if necessary.
