## Description

Trying something new with Deep Rock Galactic: playing without the HUD. Can't see how much health I have, how far off I'm from completing the mission objective, the terrain scanner no longer works and even where the drop pod will land is a mystery.

## Build

The build I used is available on [Karl.gg](https://karl.gg/preview/21636#/). Try it out yourself!
